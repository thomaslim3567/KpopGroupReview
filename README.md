## Problem statement

Working in one of the major music entertainment company in korea, our company has multiple music group of various performance under our care. The competition in this industry is very tough. Every music group have to ensure they are constantly able to bring about new music to contiune to capture their audience or to capture new ones to remain in the industry. Once they are unable to do so other group will take this oppertunity to overtake them. The role of the music entertainment company is not only to help promote the exsiting music group but to also recuit trainees and prepare them for their debut should there be signs of the music group on the verge of disbandment. However this is a long process, as new trainees often have to go through many years of training before they are even considered when a new group is slated to be form. Thus a way to identify the remainding time before a group would be disbanded would help save the company time and resources spent on the trainees. Thus we are tasked to come up with a model to predict the expected lifespan for a music group before it would be disbanded based on their current performance history thus far. * Still having trouble determining the "baseline" for this regression problem.
